Swift2 - SheetCheats9 for Offline Access To Musician's Stage Collateral - for IOS9

Looks like a mess here - will clean soon

The Nth edition of app to store stage collateral (sheet music, screenshots) for offline access

Primarily of use on iPad on stage, but in a pinch I've used it on the iPhone.  

Now Uses IOS9 search facilities directly from springboard. Some previous unused features have been removed.
